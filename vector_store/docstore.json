Our mission is clear\u2014\nconstruct AI models that are precise, timely, and fit your business needs like a glove. \nRegardless of whether you require the use of predictive analytics, natural language \nprocessing (NLP), image recognition, or automation, our team here assures that your \nAI model is appropriately trained and fine-tuned so that it provides genuine results. \nWe are not just the same models that are available to everyone, which is why they \nare not so special. Instead, we build personalized AI products that can learn, act, \nand even expand your business. \nOur AI Model Charging & Tuning Process \nUnderstanding Your Business Needs \nThe first step is to meet with your staffers and identify goals, stumbling blocks, and \ndata needs. Only then can we be sure that the AI tool we build will deliver the results \nthat you seek. \nData Collection & Preprocessing \nIf the foundation of AI is data, then quality data is the bedrock. We do the work of \ndata collection, validation, and preprocessing to sidestep any errors and \ninconsistencies in the datasets so that models can learn from the most accurate data \npossible. \nModel Training & Fine-Tuning \nUsing high-end machine learning techniques, the team at Codework can train \nmodels from scratch or tailor existing pre-trained models to better suit your industry \nand specific application. Part of the work done at the fine-tuning stage is to improve \nthe performance of the model, to remove errors, as well as to speed up the whole \nwear process. \nEvaluation & Optimization \nEach model is subjected to complete testing and confirmation. We adjust \nhyperparameters, upgrade algorithms, and streamline processes to guarantee \nexcellent performance, as well as stability over time. \nContinuous Learning & Improvement \nAI does not exist as a fixed entity. We equip systems that change with new data, \nemploy the adaptive learning method, and keep up with your company's progress.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 39330, "end_char_idx": 46567, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae5628e9-5c1c-4a88-b752-50321fddd832": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae5628e9-5c1c-4a88-b752-50321fddd832", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f6ee1d3-1596-482d-90fc-2f744011cd0d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "45c664ad2b01a0e5ec8901a61c32356312ab0c3e6137abf84905e38e0df6edc3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "41dcede0-44f9-4f59-b66a-577b4b017b0e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4973941e108b2a1c02ba33d0428e16c1bdca5e42af3df537cc5153289fd98cc9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Model Training & Fine-Tuning \nUsing high-end machine learning techniques, the team at Codework can train \nmodels from scratch or tailor existing pre-trained models to better suit your industry \nand specific application.
